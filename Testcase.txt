Unit Test case :
Validate the uploaded file 
i) check whether we can find .txt file (for now this code can not process other extensions)
if(file.includes('.txt'))
 {        
   fnFileProcess(file)      // process the file    
 } 
else
{
   console.log('Invalid file extension')
}
ii)Check whether the file is empty or not



Check the Data :
i) validate the data --> check incorrect date value 
if we found we should ignore the data 

Add multiple End without start and start without End 
i) to check the whether it is counting session properly we can have  number session

Give different timestamp to check whether it is calculation as per the requirements
